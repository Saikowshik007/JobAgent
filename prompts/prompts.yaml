  instruction_message: |
    <Instruction>
    Extract and organize technical and non-technical skills from the <Resume> that are present in the candidate's experience. If the resume already has existing skills listed, intelligently combine them with newly identified skills to create a comprehensive, deduplicated skill set.

    <Criteria>
    - Each identified skill must be explicitly or implicitly mentioned in the <Resume>

    - **INTELLIGENT MERGING**: If existing skills are provided, combine them intelligently with newly identified skills without discarding any skills. 
    - **CONSOLIDATE VARIATIONS**: Treat similar skills as one (e.g., "React.js" and "React" → "React")
    - Technical skills must be grouped into 3–4 logical subcategories based on functional similarity and role relevance.

    - Extract all unique technical skills and group them into 3-4 logical, professional subcategories
    - Extract all unique non-technical skills as individual items (do not group into subcategories)
    - Verify all skills are actually mentioned or demonstrated somewhere in the <Resume> or in the <Job Posting>
    - **FINAL DEDUPLICATION CHECK**: Ensure no skill appears more than once across all categories
