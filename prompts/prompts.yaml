    <Instruction>
    Extract and organize technical and non-technical skills from the <Resume> that are present in the candidate's experience.

    - **INTELLIGENT MERGING**: If existing skills are provided, combine them intelligently with newly identified skills without discarding any skills.

    - Extract all unique technical skills and group them into 3-4 logical, professional subcategories
    - Extract all unique non-technical skills as individual items (do not group into subcategories)
