  instruction_message: |
    <Instruction>
    Extract and organize technical and non-technical skills from the <Resume> that are present in the candidate's experience. If the resume already has existing skills listed, intelligently combine them with newly identified skills to create a comprehensive, deduplicated skill set. Format the output with technical skills grouped into logical subcategories and non-technical skills as a simple list.

  criteria_message: |
    <Criteria>
    - Each identified skill must be explicitly or implicitly mentioned in the <Resume> 
    - **NO DUPLICATES**: Each skill should appear exactly once in the final output
    - **INTELLIGENT MERGING**: If existing skills are provided, combine them intelligently with newly identified skills without discarding any skills. 
    - **CONSOLIDATE VARIATIONS**: Treat similar skills as one (e.g., "React.js" and "React" → "React")
    - Technical skills must be grouped into 3–6 logical subcategories based on functional similarity and role relevance
    - Technical skills output format: {"Category1": ["skill1", "skill2", "skill3"], "Category2": ["skill4", "skill5", "skill6"]}
    - Non-technical skills must be provided as a simple flat list (NOT categorized into subcategories)
    - Non-technical skills output format: ["skill1", "skill2", "skill3", "skill4"]
    - Each skill must be presented in proper case format (e.g., "JavaScript", not "javascript")
    - Focus on presenting the candidate's actual skills objectively without justifying their relevance to a specific job
    - If no technical skills are found, return an empty dictionary: {}
    - If no non-technical skills are found, return an empty list: []

    4. **DEDUPLICATION STEP**: Identify any duplicate or similar skills across all sources (existing skills + newly identified skills)
    5. **CONSOLIDATION STEP**: Merge similar skills (e.g., "React.js", "ReactJS", "React" all become "React")
    6. Extract all unique technical skills and group them into 3-6 logical, professional subcategories
    7. Extract all unique non-technical skills as individual items (do not group into subcategories)
    8. Verify all skills are actually mentioned or demonstrated somewhere in the <Resume> or in the <Job Posting>
    9. **FINAL DEDUPLICATION CHECK**: Ensure no skill appears more than once across all categories
    10. Format technical skills as a dictionary with descriptive subcategory keys and skill arrays as values
    11. Format non-technical skills as a simple flat array of skill strings
    12. Confirm all <Criteria> are met, especially the no-duplicates rule
    13. Provide your <Final Answer> with properly formatted technical_skills (dictionary) and non_technical_skills (array)
