    {section}

  instruction_message: |
    <Instruction> 
    Transform the relevant portions from the <Resume> that match the <Job Posting> into technically detailed, credible highlights that demonstrate specific implementation expertise and measurable impact. Rate the technical credibility and relevance of each highlight to the <Job Posting> on a scale of 1-5.

  criteria_message: |
    <Criteria> 
    TECHNICAL CREDIBILITY REQUIREMENTS:
    - Each highlight must include specific technical implementation details (tools, methodologies, architectures used)
    - Must specify concrete baseline and target metrics with measurement methods
    - Include scale and scope details (data volume, user count, transaction throughput, etc.)
    - Mention specific technologies, frameworks, and tools used for implementation and monitoring
    - Replace vague percentages with concrete numbers and units when possible
    - Show progression from problem identification to solution implementation to measurable outcome
    
    CONTENT REQUIREMENTS:
    - Each highlight must be based on actual experience mentioned in the <Resume>
    - Demonstrate technical depth that proves hands-on implementation experience
    - Include business or operational impact where relevant
    - Incorporate relevant ATS keywords naturally within technical context
    - Use action verbs that show technical ownership (architected, implemented, optimized, configured, etc.)
    - Maintain professional grammar and technical accuracy
    - Each highlight should be 20-25 words maximum with ONE primary technical achievement
    - Focus on single, clear technical accomplishment per bullet point
    - Avoid generic claims like "improved efficiency by X%" without specific context
    
    READABILITY REQUIREMENTS:
    - Maximum 25 words per bullet point
    - One primary technical achievement per bullet
    - 1-2 key technologies mentioned (not 3-4)
    - Avoid run-on sentences and complex technical jargon chains
    - Ensure bullets are scannable within 3-5 seconds
    - Split complex achievements into multiple focused bullets if needed
    - Use consistent metric formatting: "from X to Y" or "by X%" (never mix formats)
    - Always include "by" before percentages ("increasing throughput by 60%")
    - Prefer concrete baselines over standalone percentages when possible
    
    CREDIBILITY FILTERS:
    - Could another senior engineer understand and potentially replicate the work described?
    - Are the technical details specific enough to demonstrate actual implementation knowledge?
    - Are the metrics meaningful and verifiable?
    - Does the highlight show technical problem-solving ability rather than just task completion?

  steps_message: |
    <Steps>
    - Create a <Plan> for transforming resume content into technically credible highlights
    - Identify <Technical Gaps> in current resume language that need specific implementation details
    - For each relevant experience, apply the <STAR-T Framework>:
      * Situation: What technical challenge or requirement existed?
      * Task: What specific technical objective needed to be achieved?
      * Action: What specific technologies, tools, methodologies, and implementation approaches were used?
      * Result: What concrete, measurable outcomes were achieved with specific metrics and measurement tools?
      * Technology: What specific tech stack, tools, and monitoring systems were employed?
    - <Enhance Each Highlight> by adding:
      * ONE specific technical implementation detail per bullet
      * Concrete baseline and target metrics (when space allows)
      * Scale and scope context
      * 1-2 key tools or technologies (avoid technology lists)
      * Focus on single, clear technical achievement
    - <Verify Technical Credibility> by ensuring each highlight:
      * Includes specific tools, frameworks, or technologies
      * Shows measurable impact with concrete numbers
      * Demonstrates technical depth beyond surface-level task completion
      * Could be understood and evaluated by a technical interviewer
    - <ATS Optimization> by naturally incorporating relevant keywords within technical context
    - <Final Review> to ensure all highlights meet technical credibility standards and formatting consistency:
      * Check metric formatting consistency ("from X to Y" vs "by X%")
      * Ensure "by" precedes all percentages
      * Verify no vague efficiency claims without context
      * Confirm technology count per bullet (max 2)
      * Validate grammar and professional tone
    - Provide the final optimized highlights with prefix <Final Answer>
