JOB_DESCRIPTION:
  company: >
    Extract the EXACT company name from the job posting. Look for company branding, headers, or explicit mentions.
    Common locations: page header, footer, "About [Company]" section, copyright notice.
    If the posting is from a recruiter/agency, extract the hiring company name, NOT the recruiting firm.
    Return null only if absolutely no company information is available.

  location: >
    Extract the job location with maximum specificity available. Prefer format: "City, State/Province, Country" or "City, Country".
    Look for: explicit location mentions, office address, "based in", "located in", timezone references.
    For remote positions, check if location restrictions apply (e.g., "Remote - US only", "Remote within EU").
    IMPORTANT: If the job mentions "Remote" or "Work from home", still extract the office/headquarters location if mentioned.
    Return null ONLY if no location information exists anywhere in the posting.
    Examples: "San Francisco, CA, USA", "London, UK", "Remote - United States", "Bangalore, India", "Remote - No restrictions"

  job_type: >
    Determine work arrangement from these options ONLY: "On-site", "Hybrid", "Remote"
    - "On-site": Must work from office/physical location full-time (look for "in-office", "on-site", no remote mention)
    - "Hybrid": Combination of office and remote work (look for "hybrid", "flexible", "2-3 days in office", "office optional")
    - "Remote": Work from home full-time (look for "fully remote", "100% remote", "work from anywhere", "distributed team")
    Check multiple sections: job title, location field, benefits, "About the role" section.
    If conflicting information exists, prioritize explicit statements over implicit ones.
    Return null if genuinely ambiguous or not mentioned.

  job_title: >
    Extract the EXACT job title as advertised. Do NOT normalize or simplify.
    Preserve level indicators: "Senior", "Staff", "Principal", "Lead", "Junior", "Mid-level", "III", "II"
    Preserve specializations: "Full Stack", "Frontend", "Backend", "DevOps", "ML", "Security"
    Look in: page title, header, "Position:", "Role:", "We're hiring for"
    Examples: "Senior Software Engineer - Platform", "Staff Data Scientist (ML/AI)", "Principal Backend Engineer"
    If multiple titles exist (e.g., different levels offered), extract the primary/highlighted one.

  team: >
    Extract the specific team, department, or business unit this role belongs to.
    Look for: "Join our [Team] team", "Part of [Department]", "Reporting to [Team]", organizational structure mentions.
    Examples: "Platform Engineering", "Data Science & ML", "Infrastructure Team", "Product - Search", "Core Backend"
    Distinguish between company-wide culture statements and actual team names.
    Return null if only generic department mentions (e.g., just "Engineering") or no specific team identified.

  job_summary: >
    Create a concise summary capturing:
    1. What the role does (core function/purpose)
    2. Key technical focus areas or technologies
    3. Team/product context if mentioned
    4. Impact or scope of the role
    Extract from: "About the role", "What you'll do", "Role overview", opening paragraphs.
    Be specific and technical, avoid marketing fluff. Focus on substantive information.
    If no dedicated summary exists, synthesize from responsibilities and company info.

  salary: >
    Extract ANY compensation information mentioned. Include:
    - Base salary range (e.g., "$120,000 - $150,000", "€80k-95k", "₹25-35 LPA")
    - Total compensation if specified (e.g., "$150k-$200k total comp")
    - Equity/stock options if mentioned (e.g., "$130k + equity")
    - Hourly rates for contract roles (e.g., "$75-95/hour")
    Look in: dedicated compensation section, "What we offer", benefits section, fine print.
    Preserve currency symbols and units exactly as written.
    Return null ONLY if no compensation information exists anywhere.

  duties: >
    Extract 5-15 specific responsibilities, tasks, and day-to-day activities as an itemized list.
    Look in: "Responsibilities", "What you'll do", "Day-to-day", "Role expectations", "You will"
    Each item should be:
    - Specific and actionable (not vague goals)
    - Focused on WHAT work is done, not WHAT QUALITIES are needed
    - Include technical details when mentioned (languages, tools, systems)
    Examples of GOOD items:
    - "Design and implement RESTful APIs using Python and FastAPI"
    - "Collaborate with product managers to define technical requirements"
    - "Conduct code reviews and mentor junior engineers"
    Examples of BAD items (these are qualifications, not duties):
    - "Strong communication skills"
    - "Experience with Python"
    Exclude marketing language and company culture statements.
    Maximum 500 words total. If list is very long, prioritize explicit responsibilities over nice-to-haves.

    Look in: "Requirements", "Qualifications", "What we're looking for", "You have", "Ideal candidate"
    Include:
    - Years of experience requirements (e.g., "5+ years in software development")
    - Technical skill requirements (e.g., "Proficiency in React and TypeScript")
    - Educational requirements (e.g., "BS in Computer Science or equivalent")
    - Certifications (e.g., "AWS Solutions Architect certification")
    - Soft skills (e.g., "Excellent written and verbal communication")
    - Domain knowledge (e.g., "Experience in fintech or healthcare")
    Distinguish between "Required" and "Nice to have" if specified, but include both.
    Each item should be a complete requirement, not fragmented.
    Maximum 500 words total. Prioritize explicit requirements over vague preferences.

    DOMAINS: Industry/technical domains
    - Examples: Machine Learning, Cloud Computing, DevOps, Data Engineering, Security
    CERTIFICATIONS: Relevant certifications if mentioned
    - Examples: AWS Certified, PMP, CISSP
    SOFT SKILLS: Key professional competencies
    - Examples: Leadership, Cross-functional Collaboration, Communication

    IMPORTANT RULES:
    - Use EXACT terminology from job posting (e.g., "React.js" if they wrote "React.js", not "React")
    - Include variations if mentioned (e.g., both "ML" and "Machine Learning")

    - Exclude company-specific jargon or overly generic terms
    - Include both acronyms and full forms when both appear (e.g., "CI/CD", "Continuous Integration")
    Maximum 30 keywords. Focus on terms that appear multiple times or in "Required" sections.

  is_fully_remote: >
    Boolean field determining if role is 100% remote with NO office requirement.
    - True: Fully remote, work from anywhere, no office visits required, distributed team
    - False: Any office requirement (on-site, hybrid, "remote with occasional office visits", location-restricted)
    - None/null: Cannot determine from job posting

    IMPORTANT DISTINCTIONS:
    - "Remote" alone without clarification → check for location restrictions
    - "Remote within [region]" → True (location-restricted but fully remote)
    - "Hybrid" or "Flexible" → False (not fully remote)
    - "Remote with quarterly team meetups" → True (still fully remote, occasional travel OK)
    - "Remote option available" → False (implies default is not remote)

    - Separate related but distinct skills: ["AWS", "S3", "Lambda"] not just ["AWS"]
    - Exclude vague categories: don't list "databases" if specific databases are mentioned
    - Prioritize required skills over nice-to-haves
    Return as a flat list of strings, NOT categorized in this field.
